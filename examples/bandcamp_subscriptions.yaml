# Define any number subscriptions in a single file, or use multiple

# TEMPLATE
# sub_name:
#   preset:
#     - "bandcamp"
#     #- "tired" # wait 1s between all requests, 10s for downloads
#     #- "sleepy" # wait 1s between initial, between 5-18s for downloads
#   overrides:
#     artist: "<required>"
#     genre: "<required by default>"
#     url: "<required>"

# Example

# If trying to snag all available discography for an artist on Bandcamp,
# recommend using https://artist.bandcamp.com/music format. Some artists
# default to this page, but many default to a track or album. If you want all
# media scraped, use /music format.
#
# If you do not want to set genre manually via overrides, you must set the
# default value in bandcamp-config.yaml and remove the genre override here.
